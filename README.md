# Intrusion Detection System - KDDCup Dataset

This project was developed during my internship at the **National Telecommunication Institute (NTI)**.  
It implements machine learning models for **intrusion detection** using the **KDDCup dataset**.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine Learning models: KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Neural Network model with Keras
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, F1-score)
- Visualization of results (heatmaps, scatterplots, training curves)

## 📊 Dataset
We used the **KDDCup 99 dataset-10-percent**, which contains network traffic data labeled as normal or attack categories.

## 🏆 Results
The models were trained and evaluated, with **Random Forest and Neural Network** achieving the best overall performance.
